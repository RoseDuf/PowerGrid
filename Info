Part 3: Game play: main game loop Phase 3 and 4 

Provide a group of C++ classes that implements the main game loop 
following the rules of the POWER GRID game. During the main game loop 
that has five phases. In each phase, all players take their actions 
in the order specified for the phase before the game continues with the next phase.  
In this part you are implementing phase 3 and 4. 3. Buying Resources, where the 
players can buy resources for their power plants from the resource market. 
This phase is played in reverse player order. 4. Building, where the players 
start or add cities to their networks on the map. 
 
You must deliver a driver that demonstrates that :

1) the buying resources phase and 
2) the building phase and 
3) the possession of each player at the end of phase 4.
